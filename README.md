# Try LÖVE (love2d)

LÖVE (aka love2d) is a framework for creating 2D games.
It uses [Lua][lua] for scripting and [SDL][sdl] for the
backend. LÖVE and games written for it run on Linux,
macOS, and Windows, as well as on iPhone and Android.

## Idea/Plan

Small LÖVE based application that offers a main menu
from where demonstrations of Lode's CG Tutorial can
be chosen and run.

Tutorials followed and trials done may be in subfolders.

## Tooling

- LÖVE v11.5 (“Mysterious Mysteries”, latest as of early 2024)
- Lua v5.1 (included with LÖVE 11.5; latest as of 2024 is Lua 5.4)
- VS Code with the *Love2D Support* extension
- but any text editor will do...

The *Love2D Support* extension for VS Code allows hitting
**Alt+L** to run LÖVE on the current project folder (or
any folder configured in the extension settings; also in
settings: path to love.exe).

## Resources

- <https://love2d.org/> – the LÖVE home page
- <https://love2d-community.github.io> – LÖVE community
  page, offering a curated and categorized list of
  libraries, tools, and resources
- <https://simplegametutorials.github.io/love/> – looks
  like a very carefully created set of tutorial games,
  including Snake, Fifeteen, Blackjack, etc.
- <https://lodev.org/cgtutor/> – Lode's Computer Graphics
  Tutorial, including some oldskool effects like fire and
  plasma, but also raycasting, fractals, color, image...
- <https://github.com/flamendless/Slab> – Slab seems to be
  a popular GUI library (Lua-only immediate mode) for LÖVE
- <https://github.com/rxi> – notoriously clean code, both
  Lua and C, from an anonymous guy known as “rxi”
